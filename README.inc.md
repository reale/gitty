# Gitty

A client for the [GitHub REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/), written in Bash.


## Installation

Gitty requires the [`bashlets`](https://github.com/reale/bashlets) base package.


## Configuration

### Authentication

The library supports both basic and OAuth authentication.

Basic authentication is supported through the environment variable `BASHLETS_CORE_GITHUB_API_BASIC_AUTH`, which must contain the username.

[OAuth authentication](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/), on the other hand, is supported through the environment variable `BASHLETS_CORE_GITHUB_API_OAUTH_TOKEN`.

### User agent

All API requests [MUST](https://developer.github.com/v3/#user-agent-required) include a valid `User-Agent` header. The library supports a custom header through the environment variables `BASHLETS_USER_AGENT` and `BASHLETS_CORE_GITHUB_API_USER_AGENT`.
